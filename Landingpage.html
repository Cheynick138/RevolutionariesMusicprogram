   <p>The way we perceive and create music is forever changing. To prepare our future artists, we have decided to open our own school studio to push our student to the future of sound. For decades, schools have offered all of the standard music classes including, choir, orchestra, and band but for some reason we have been neglecting the fact that most top selling music is created in a recording studio using computers, audio interfaces, studio monitors, and much more. When making music at Revolution High it is not just singing, it is not just playing an instrument, and it is not just tossing our students into the studio and letting them make a hodge podge of sound, our teachers are skilled in making music and do their best to make sure the students know the beauty of sound and how to create their own fresh beats. Music is on a much wider spectrum than that of which you would hear on the radio, at  a party, or in an elevator. Music is also the soundtrack of classic films like The Breakfast Club, Purple Rain, 8 Mile, and Saturday Night Fever. Music is the sound you hear when you finally get a powerup in games like Mario. Music is even the sweet “ding” you hear when you get a text from your best friend. At Revolution High we will create the future musical engineers, A&R coordinators, Production Music writers, music teachers, music directors, and many others. No matter the profession, we will do our best to prepare our students to take the music industry by storm with the lessons learned in our brand new facility.
